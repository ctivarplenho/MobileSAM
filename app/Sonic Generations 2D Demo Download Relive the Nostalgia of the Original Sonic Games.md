Here is an example of a review of Sonic Generations 2D demo:

> Sonic Generations 2D is a fan-made game that pays tribute to the 20 years of Sonic history by recreating classic and modern stages from various Sonic games in a 2D perspective. The game lets you play as both Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, each with their own gameplay style and abilities. The demo includes three stages: Green Hill Act 2 from Sonic 1, Speed Highway Act 1 from Sonic Adventure, and Wave Coast Act 1 from Sonic 06.

> 
> I had a lot of fun playing this game, as it captured the essence of what makes Sonic games great: speed, platforming, and exploration. The game looks amazing, with colorful graphics and smooth animations that bring the stages to life. The game also sounds great, with remixed music and sound effects that fit the mood of each stage. The game runs smoothly on my PC, with no noticeable bugs or glitches.
> 
> 
> The gameplay is fast and fluid, with both Sonics having their own advantages and disadvantages. Classic Sonic is more agile and can use the spin dash to gain momentum and break through obstacles. Modern Sonic is more powerful and can use the homing attack to target enemies and jump pads. Both Sonics can also use power-ups like shields and invincibility to enhance their performance. The stages are well-designed, with multiple paths and secrets to discover. The stages also switch between 2D and 3D perspectives at certain points, adding some variety and challenge to the gameplay.

> The only downside of this game is that it is too short. The demo only offers three stages, which can be completed in less than 10 minutes each.
