The film revolves around Siva, a powerful and dynamic young man who has seemingly invincible powers like a typical Telugu hero. He can stop bullets, challenge time and even make Posani Krishna Murali speak intelligently. He falls in love with Priya, the daughter of a corrupt politician, and faces various enemies, such as Thikkal Reddy, a ruthless gangster who wants to kill him since his birth, Jaffa Reddy, a CBI officer who is actually a spy for Thikkal Reddy, and Don D, a mysterious criminal mastermind who turns out to be his own grandmother. Siva also reveals that he is actually an undercover cop named Siva Manohar IPS, who is on a mission to eliminate all the villains and restore justice.
